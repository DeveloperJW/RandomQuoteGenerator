# RandomQuoteGenerator
This project is created for the purpose of Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree Unit 01.
The webpage will display a random quote to the page.

#Extra Credit:

- users are able to view a profile image of the author of the quote
- if users are curious about the author, they can click on the profile img and redirect to wiki pages

#2: Created a array bg-color contains a list of color
- when the button is clicked, the background color is changing with the quotes

#3: auto refresh after inactivity of 20 seconds
- when users did not click the button for 20 seconds, a new quote is automatically generated.
